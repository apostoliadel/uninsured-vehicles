# Project: Message Generator for Uninsured Vehicles

The goal of this project is to save time and effort by automating message creation for expired contracts. Instead of writing messages manually for each contract, this tool makes it easier by creating consistent and accurate messages.

## How it Works

1. You enter important details like the client's name, contract duration, license plate, vehicle type, and renewal price.

2. The program checks the information you provided and creates a message accordingly.

3. The message includes a friendly greeting, the vehicle's details (license plate, owner, type), crucial information about uninsured vehicles, and possible penalties.

4. It also mentions the previous contract length and price for reference.

## Benefits

- Saves time and effort by automating message generation. 

- Guarantees accurate messages for expired contracts and reduces mistakes. 

- Provides a standardized format of communication regarding uninsured vehicles and penalties.
